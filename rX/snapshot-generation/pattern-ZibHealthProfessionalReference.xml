  <description value="A Reference datatype profile for referring [zib HealthProfessional](https://zibs.nl/wiki/HealthProfessional-v3.5(2020EN)) from other zib profiles. This datatype profile is used in various resource profiles and is never instantiated directly." />
  <purpose value="This profile provides guidance to implementers on how to refer instances of this zib. Profilers should use this datatype profile for all references to zib HealthProfessional (`type.profile`). In addition, profile &lt;http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-HealthProfessional-PractitionerRole&gt; should be added to the list of `type.targetProfile`'s. The original list of `type.targetProfile`'s should not be restricted.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;The `.title` of this profile is simply 'Reference' instead of 'zib HealthProfessional Reference', as is expected following the profiling guidelines. This deviation from the guidelines is the result of the `.title` being used to render the profile in various tooling (mainly Simplifier), and the latter title would result in a rendering that is deemed confusing in some cases (see [MM-3854](https://bits.nictiz.nl/browse/MM-3854))." />

      <comment value="Each occurrence of the zib HealthProfessional is normally represented by _two_ FHIR resources: a PractitionerRole resource (instance of [zib-HealthProfessional-PractitionerRole](http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-HealthProfessional-PractitionerRole)) and a Practitioner resource (instance of [zib-HealthProfessional-Practitioner](http://nictiz.nl/fhir/StructureDefinition/zib-HealthProfessional-Practitioner)). The Practitioner resource is referenced from the PractitionerRole instance. For this reason, sending systems should fill the reference to the PractitionerRole instance here, and not the Practitioner resource. Receiving systems can then retrieve the reference to the Practitioner resource from that PractitionerRole instance.&#xD;&#xA;&#xD;&#xA;In rare circumstances, there is only a Practitioner instance, in which case it is that instance which will be referenced here. However, since this should be the exception, the zib-HealthProfessional-Practitioner profile is not explicitly mentioned as a target profile." />
