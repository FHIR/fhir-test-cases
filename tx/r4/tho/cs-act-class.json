Any profession or business, including healthcare, is primarily constituted of intentional and occasionally non-intentional actions, performed and recorded by responsible actors. An Act-instance is a record of such an action.\r\n\r\nActs connect to Entities in their Roles through Participations and connect to other Acts through ActRelationships. Participations are the authors, performers and other responsible parties as well as subjects and beneficiaries (which includes tools and material used in the performance of the act, which are also subjects). The moodCode distinguishes between Acts that are meant as factual records, vs. records of intended or ordered services, and the other modalities in which act can appear.\r\n\r\nOne of the Participations that all acts have (at least implicitly) is a primary author, who is responsible of the Act and who \"owns\" the act. Responsibility for the act means responsibility for what is being stated in the Act and as what it is stated. Ownership of the act is assumed in the sense of who may operationally modify the same act. Ownership and responsibility of the Act is not the same as ownership or responsibility of what the Act-object refers to in the real world. The same real world activity can be described by two people, each being the author of their Act, describing the same real world activity. Yet one can be a witness while the other can be a principal performer. The performer has responsibilities for the physical actions; the witness only has responsibility for making a true statement to the best of his or her ability. The two Act-instances may even disagree, but because each is properly attributed to its author, such disagreements can exist side by side and left to arbitration by a recipient of these Act-instances.\r\n\r\nIn this sense, an Act-instance represents a \"statement\" according to Rector and Nowlan (1991) \\[Foundations for an electronic medical record. Methods Inf Med. 30.\\] Rector and Nowlan have emphasized the importance of understanding the medical record not as a collection of facts, but \"a faithful record of what clinicians have heard, seen, thought, and done.\" Rector and Nowlan go on saying that \"the other requirements for a medical record, e.g., that it be attributable and permanent, follow naturally from this view.\" Indeed the Act class is this attributable statement, and the rules of updating acts (discussed in the state-transition model, see Act.statusCode) versus generating new Act-instances are designed according to this principle of permanent attributable statements.\r\n\r\nRector and Nolan focus on the electronic medical record as a collection of statements, while attributed statements, these are still mostly factual statements. However, the Act class goes beyond this limitation to attributed factual statements, representing what is known as \"speech-acts\" in linguistics and philosophy. The notion of speech-act includes that there is pragmatic meaning in language utterances, aside from just factual statements; and that these utterances interact with the real world to change the state of affairs, even directly cause physical activities to happen. For example, an order is a speech act that (provided it is issued adequately) will cause the ordered action to be physically performed. The speech act theory has culminated in the seminal work by Austin (1962) \\[How to do things with words. Oxford University Press\\].\r\n\r\nAn activity in the real world may progress from defined, through planned and ordered to executed, which is represented as the mood of the Act. Even though one might think of a single activity as progressing from planned to executed, this progression is reflected by multiple Act-instances, each having one and only one mood that will not change along the Act-instance life cycle. This is because the attribution and content of speech acts along this progression of an activity may be different, and it is often critical that a permanent and faithful record be maintained of this progression. The specification of orders or promises or plans must not be overwritten by the specification of what was actually done, so as to allow comparing actions with their earlier specifications. Act-instances that describe this progression of the same real world activity are linked through the ActRelationships (of the relationship category \"sequel\").\r\n\r\nAct as statements or speech-acts are the only representation of real world facts or processes in the HL7 RIM. The truth about the real world is constructed through a combination (and arbitration) of such attributed statements only, and there is no class in the RIM whose objects represent \"objective state of affairs\" or \"real processes\" independent from attributed statements. As such, there is no distinction between an activity and its documentation. Every Act includes both to varying degrees. For example, a factual statement made about recent (but past) activities, authored (and signed) by the performer of such activities, is commonly known as a procedure report or original documentation (e.g., surgical procedure report, clinic note etc.). Conversely, a status update on an activity that is presently in progress, authored by the performer (or a close observer) is considered to capture that activity (and is later superceded by a full procedure report). However, both status update and procedure report are acts of the same kind, only distinguished by mood and state (see statusCode) and completeness of the information.","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"active"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"13856"},{"code":"Name:Class","valueCode":"Act"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"DOCCNTNT","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"retired"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"14785"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"DOCLIST","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"retired"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"14787"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"DOCLSTITM","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"retired"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"14789"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"DOCPARA","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"retired"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"14786"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"DOCTBL","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"retired"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"14784"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"LINKHTML","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"retired"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"16902"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"LOCALATTR","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"retired"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"16903"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"LOCALMRKP","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"retired"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"16904"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"ordered","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"retired"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"10979"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"REFR","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"retired"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"11538"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"TBLCOL","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"retired"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"14782"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"TBLCOLGP","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"retired"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"14783"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"TBLDATA","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"retired"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"14776"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"TBLHDR","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"retired"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"14775"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"TBLROW","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"retired"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"14778"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"tbody","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"retired"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"11009"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"tfoot","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"retired"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"11010"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"thead","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"retired"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"11011"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"unordered","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"retired"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"10980"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"ENTRY","display":"entry","definition":"This context represents the information acquired and recorded for an observation, a clinical statement such as a portion of the patient's history or an inference or assertion, or an action that might be intended or has actually been performed.

Public health and/or safety authorities may also be interested in documenting this with an associated exposure.\r\n *  A patient accidentally is dispensed an incorrect medicine (e.g., clomiphene instead of clomipramine). They have taken several doses before the mistake is detected. They are therefore \"exposed\" to a medicine that there was no therapeutic indication for them to receive.\r\n    \r\n     *  There are several substance administrations in this example. Public health and/or safety authorities may also be interested in documenting this with associated exposures.\r\n *  In a busy medical ward, a patient is receiving chemotherapy for a lymphoma. Unfortunately, the IV infusion bag containing the medicine splits, spraying cytotoxic medication over the patient being treated and the patient in the adjacent bed.\r\n    \r\n     *  There are three substance administrations in this example. The first is the intended one (IV infusion) with its associated (implicit) exposure. There is an incident with an associated substance administration to the same patient involving the medication sprayed over the patient as well as an associated exposure. Additionally, the incident includes a substance administration involving the spraying of medication on the adjacent patient, also with an associated exposure.\r\n *  A patient who is a refugee from a war-torn African nation arrives in a busy inner city A&E department suffering from a cough with bloody sputum. Not understanding the registration and triage process, they sit in the waiting room for several hours before it is noticed that they have not booked in. As soon as they are being processed, it is suspected that they are suffering from TB. Vulnerable (immunosuppressed) patients who were sharing the waiting room with this patient may have been exposed to the tubercule bacillus, and must be traced for investigation.\r\n    \r\n     *  This is an exposure (or possibly multiple exposures) in the waiting room involving the refugee and everyone else in the waiting room during the period. There might also be a number of known or presumed substance administrations (coughing) via several possible routes. The substance administrations are only hypotheses until confirmed by further testing.\r\n *  A patient who has received an elective total hip replacement procedure suffers a prolonged stay in hospital, due to contracting an MRSA infection in the surgical wound site after the surgery.\r\n    \r\n     *  This is an exposure to MRSA. Although there was some sort of substance administration, it's possible the exact mechanism for introduction of the MRSA into the wound will not be identified.\r\n *  Routine maintenance of the X-ray machines at a local hospital reveals a serious breach of the shielding on one of the machines. Patients who have undergone investigations using that machine in the last month are likely to have been exposed to significantly higher doses of X-rays than was intended, and must be tracked for possible adverse effects.\r\n    \r\n     *  There has been an exposure of each patient who used the machine in the past 30 days. Some patients may have had substance administrations.\r\n *  A new member of staff is employed in the laundry processing room of a small cottage hospital, and a misreading of the instructions for adding detergents results in fifty times the usual concentration of cleaning materials being added to a batch of hospital bedding. As a result, several patients have been exposed to very high levels of detergents still present in the \"clean\" bedding, and have experienced dermatological reactions to this.\r\n    \r\n     *  There has been an incident with multiple exposures to several patients. Although there are substance administrations involving the application of the detergent to the skin of the patients, it is expected that the substance administrations would not be directly documented.\r\n *  Seven patients who are residents in a health care facility for the elderly mentally ill have developed respiratory problems. After several months of various tests having been performed and various medications prescribed to these patients, the problem is traced to their being \"sensitive\" to a new fungicide used in the wall plaster of the ward where these patients reside.\r\n    \r\n     *  The patients have been continuously exposed to the fungicide. Although there have been continuous substance administrations (via breathing) this would not normally be documented as a substance administration.\r\n *  A patient with osteoarthritis of the knees is treated symptomatically using analgesia, paracetamol (acetaminophen) 1g up to four times a day for pain relief. His GP does not realize that the patient has, 20 years previously (while at college) had severe alcohol addiction problems, and now, although this is completely under control, his liver has suffered significantly, leaving him more sensitive to hepatic toxicity from paracetamol use. Later that year, the patient returns with a noticeable level of jaundice. Paracetamol is immediately withdrawn and alternative solutions for the knee pain are sought. The jaundice gradually subsides with conservative management, but referral to the gastroenterologist is required for advice and monitoring.\r\n    \r\n     *  There is a substance administration with an associated exposure. The exposure component is based on the relative toxic level of the substance to a patient with a compromised liver function.\r\n *  A patient goes to their GP complaining of abdominal pain, having been discharged from the local hospital ten days' previously after an emergency appendectomy. The GP can find nothing particularly amiss, and presumes it is post operative surgical pain that will resolve. The patient returns a fortnight later, when the GP prescribes further analgesia, but does decide to request an outpatient surgical follow-up appointment. At this post-surgical outpatient review, the registrar decides to order an ultrasound, which, when performed three weeks later, shows a small faint inexplicable mass. A laparoscopy is then performed, as a day case procedure, and a piece of a surgical swab is removed from the patient's abdominal cavity. Thankfully, a full recovery then takes place.\r\n    \r\n     *  This is a procedural sequelae. There may be an Incident recorded for this also.\r\n *  A patient is slightly late for a regular pacemaker battery check in the Cardiology department of the local hospital. They are hurrying down the second floor corridor. A sudden summer squall has recently passed over the area, and rain has come in through an open corridor window leaving a small puddle on the corridor floor. In their haste, the patient slips in the puddle and falls so badly that they have to be taken to the A&E department, where it is discovered on investigation they have slightly torn the cruciate ligament in their left knee.\r\n    \r\n     *  This is not an exposure. There has been an incident.\r\n\r\n*Usage Notes:* This class deals only with opportunity and not the outcome of the exposure; i.e. not all exposed parties will necessarily experience actual harm or benefit.\r\n\r\nExposure differs from Substance Administration by the absence of the participation of a performer in the act.\r\n\r\nThe following participations SHOULD be used with the following participations to distinguish the specific entities:\r\n\r\n *  The exposed entity participates via the \"exposure target\" (EXPTRGT) participation.\r\n *  An entity that has carried the agent transmitted in the exposure participates via the \"exposure source\" (EXSRC) participation. For example:\r\n    \r\n     *  a person or animal who carried an infectious disease and interacts (EXSRC) with another person or animal (EXPTRGT) transmitting the disease agent;\r\n     *  a place or other environment (EXSRC) and a person or animal (EXPTRGT) who is exposed in the presence of this environment.\r\n *  When it is unknown whether a participating entity is the source of the agent (EXSRC) or the target of the transmission (EXPTRGT), the \"exposure participant\" (EXPART) is used.\r\n *  The physical (including energy), chemical or biological substance which is participating in the exposure uses the \"exposure agent\" (EXPAGNT) participation. There are at least three scenarios:\r\n    \r\n    1.  the player of the Role that participates as EXPAGNT is the chemical or biological substance mixed or carried by the scoper-entity of the Role (e.g., ingredient role); or\r\n    2.  the player of the Role that participates as EXPAGNT is a mixture known to contain the chemical, radiological or biological substance of interest; or\r\n    3.  the player of the Role that participates as a EXPAGNT is known to carry the agent (i.e., the player is a fomite, vector, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe Exposure.statusCode attribute should be interpreted as the state of the Exposure business object (e.g., active, aborted, completed) and not the clinical status of the exposure (e.g., probable, confirmed).

The main difference between Observations and other Acts is that Observations have a value attribute. The **code** attribute of Observation and the **value** attribute of Observation must be considered in combination to determine the semantics of the observation.\r\n\r\n**Discussion:**\r\n\r\nStructurally, many observations are name-value-pairs, where the Observation.code (inherited from Act) is the name and the Observation.value is the value of the property. Such a construct is also known as a variable (a named feature that can assume a value) hence, the Observation class is always used to hold generic name-value-pairs or variables, even though the variable valuation may not be the result of an elaborate observation method. It may be a simple answer to a question or it may be an assertion or setting of a parameter.\r\n\r\nAs with all Act statements, Observation statements describe what was done, and in the case of Observations, this includes a description of what was actually observed (results or answers); and those results or answers are part of the observation and not split off into other objects.\r\n\r\nThe method of action is asserted by the Observation classCode or its subclasses at the least granular level, by the Observation.code attribute value at the medium level of granularity, and by the attribute value of observation.methodCode when a finer level of granularity is required. The method in whole or in part may also appear in the attribute value of Observation.value when using coded data types to express the value of the attribute. Relevant aspects of methodology may also be restated in value when the results themselves imply or state a methodology.\r\n\r\nAn observation may consist of component observations each having their own Observation.code and Observation.value. In this case, the composite observation may not have an Observation.value for itself. For instance, a white blood cell count consists of the sub-observations for the counts of the various granulocytes, lymphocytes and other normal or abnormal blood cells (e.g., blasts). The overall white blood cell count Observation itself may therefore not have a value by itself (even though it could have one, e.g., the sum total of white blood cells). Thus, as long as an Act is essentially an Act of recognizing and noting information about a subject, it is an Observation, regardless of whether it has a simple value by itself or whether it has sub-observations.\r\n\r\nEven though observations are professional acts (see Act) and as such are intentional actions, this does not require that every possible outcome of an observation be pondered in advance of it being actually made. For instance, differential white blood cell counts (WBC) rarely show blasts, but if they do, this is part of the WBC observation even though blasts might not be predefined in the structure of a normal WBC.\r\n\r\nClinical documents commonly have Subjective and Objective findings, both of which are kinds of Observations. In addition, clinical documents commonly contain Assessments, which are also kinds of Observations. Thus, the establishment of a diagnosis is an Observation.\r\n\r\n**Examples:**\r\n\r\n *  Recording the results of a Family History Assessment\r\n *  Laboratory test and associated result\r\n *  Physical exam test and associated result\r\n *  Device temperature\r\n *  Soil lead level","property":[{"code":"status","valueCode":"active"},{"code":"internalId","valueCode":"11529"},{"code":"Name:Class","valueCode":"Observation"},{"code":"subsumedBy","valueCode":"ACT"},{"code":"Name:Participation:act:Act","valueString":"&"}]},{"code":"PCPR","display":"care provision","definition":"An **Act** that of taking on whole or partial responsibility for, or attention to, safety and well-being of a subject of care.\r\n\r\n*Discussion:* A **care provision** event may exist without any other care actions taking place.
