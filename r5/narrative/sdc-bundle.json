Whereas 96% of American workers had unmanaged indemnity in 1984, only 28% did in 1988. Typically, in managed care, the third-party payer requires second opinions and pre-certification review for patients requiring hospital admission. They obtain wholesale prices from doctors, and carry out cost-containment measures, including auditing hospitals and reviewing claims. Managed care has figured heavily in the national debate over health care.: A program under the U.S. Social Security Administration that reimburses hospitals and physicians for medical care provided to qualifying people over 65 years old."
